<h1>Introduction</h1>
In Vim, as in plain vi, the percent key, <kbd>%</kbd>, jumps the cursor from
a brace, bracket, or paren to its match.
(For details, type <kbd>:help %</kbd> from within Vim.)
This can be configured with the <kbd>'matchpairs'</kbd> option
(<kbd>:help 'matchpairs'</kbd>).  The script
<a href= "http://sites.netscape.net/BBenjiF/vim/beta/matchit.vim">
<kbd>matchit.vim</kbd></a>
extends this in several ways:
<ul>
	<li>You can match whole words, such as <kbd>if</kbd> and
	<kbd>endif</kbd>, not just single characters.</li>
	<li>You can define groups with more than two words, such as
	<kbd>if, else, endif</kbd>.
	Banging on the <kbd>%</kbd> will cycle from the <kbd>if</kbd> to the
	first <kbd>else</kbd>, the next <kbd>else</kbd>, ..., the closing
	<kbd>endif</kbd>, and back to the opening <kbd>if</kbd>.  Nested
	structures are skipped.</li>
	<li>By default, words inside comments are ignored, unless the cursor
	is inside a comment when you type <kbd>%</kbd>.  If the only thing you
	want to do is modify the behavior of <kbd>%</kbd> so that it treats
	comments this way, you can<br>
	<kbd>:let b:match_words = &amp;matchpairs</kbd><br>
	and source the script.
	See the description of <a href="#comments">comments</a> for
	details.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, the following languages are supported:
Ada,
ASP with VBS,
Csh,
DTD,
Entity,
Essbase,
Fortran,
HTML,
JSP (same as HTML),
LaTeX,
Lua,
Pascal,
SGML,
Shell,
Tcsh,
Vim,
XML.<br>

To support a new language, see

<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>
This script was started by Raul Segura Acevedo.  Support for comments was
added by Douglas Potts.  Support for back references and other improvements
were made by Benji Fisher, who is the current maintainer (as of April,
2000).  Johannes Zellner added support for many languages.  Suggestions for
improvement, bug reports, and support for additional languages were
contributed by
Jordi-Albert Batalla,
Neil Bird,
Mark Collett,
Stephen Wall,
and
Johannes Zellner.

<p>If you use this script and like it, type
<kbd>:help uganda</kbd>
from within Vim.</p>

<a name="install">
<h1>Installation</h1>
First,
<a href="matchit.vim">download</a> <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd>.
For these instructions, I assume that you save it as
<kbd>$VIM/matchit.vim</kbd>.
(This is appropriate on single-user systems.  For multi-user systems,
something like
<kbd>$HOME/vim/matchit.vim</kbd>
would be more reasonable.)  There is nothing magic about the directory nor the
name of the file.  Note that most users only have to follow Step 2 below.
<ol>
	<li>(optional)  If you want to "test drive" before you commit
	yourself, do<br>
	<kbd>:source $VIM/matchit.vim</kbd><br>
	within Vim.  Then open a file with one of the supported file types and
	start banging on the <kbd>%</kbd> key.  If you already have the file
	open, you will have to trigger the autocommand that defines
	<kbd>b:match_words</kbd>, so do<br>
	<kbd>:set ft=&lt;file type&gt;</kbd><br>
	where &lt;file type&gt; is the current file type:  <kbd>tex</kbd>,
	<kbd>html</kbd>, <kbd>vim</kbd>, or whatever.
	</li>
	<li>Add the line<br>
	<kbd>:source $VIM/matchit.vim</kbd><br>
	to your vimrc file.  (If you do not have a vimrc file, read
	<kbd>:help vimrc</kbd>
	within Vim.)  It should start working the next time you start Vim.  If
	you are impatient and do not want to restart Vim, see the previous
	step.</li>
	<li>(trouble shooting)  What if nothing happens?  Check the file
	<kbd>matchit.vim</kbd> and look for a line like<br>
	<kbd>au FileType html ...</kbd><br>
	for the file type you are using.  If your file type is not yet
	supported, go to the section on
	<a href="#newlang">supporting a new language</a>.
	If it is supported, return to the file you were editing and type<br>
	<kbd>:echo b:match_words&lt;CR&gt;</kbd><br>
	where <kbd>&lt;CR&gt;</kbd> means a carriage-return.  If this is not
	set as indicated in the autocommand, try<br>
	<kbd>:filetype on<br>
		:set ft=&lt;file type&gt;</kbd><br>
	You should consider adding a
	<kbd>:filetype on</kbd>
	or
	<kbd>:syntax on</kbd>
	line to your vimrc file (or gvimrc file).  If <kbd>b:match_words</kbd>
	is still not set, check that the autocommand has been defined:<br>
	<kbd>:au Matchit FileType &lt;file type&gt;</kbd><br>
	This should show an autocommand to set <kbd>b:match_words</kbd>.  If
	it does not, try sourcing <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd> again.  If the
	autocommand is there but <kbd>b:match_words</kbd> is still not set, I
	am stumped.  Maybe you should replace <kbd>FileType html</kbd> in the
	autocommand with <kbd>BufRead,BufNewFile *.html</kbd> or whatever.
	Maybe it is time to <a href="#support">ask for help</a>.
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="configure">
<h1>Configuration</h1>
There are several variables (and one highlight group) that govern the behavior
of <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd>.  Note that these are variables local to the buffer,
not options, so use <kbd>:let</kbd> to define them, not <kbd>:set</kbd>.  Some
of these variables have values that matter; for others, it only matters
whether the variable has been defined.  All of these can be defined in the
autocommand that defines <kbd>b:match_words</kbd> or "on the fly."
<ul>
	<li><kbd>b:match_words</kbd>:
	This is the main variable.  See the section below on
	<a href="#newlang">supporting a new language</a>.</li>
	<li><kbd>MatchError</kbd>:
	This is the highlight group for error messages from the script.  By
	default, it is linked to WarningMsg.  If you do not want to be bothered
	by error messages, you can define this to be something invisible.  For
	example, if you use the GUI version of Vim and your command line is
	normally white, you can do<br>
	<kbd>hi MatchError guifg=white guibg=white</kbd></li>
	<li><kbd>b:match_ignorecase</kbd>:
	If you<br>
	<kbd>:let b:match_ignorecase = 1</kbd><br>
	then <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd> acts as if <kbd>'ignorecase'</kbd> is set:
	for example, <kbd>"end"</kbd> and <kbd>"END"</kbd> are equivalent.
	If you<br>
	<kbd>:let b:match_ignorecase = 0</kbd><br>
	then <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd> treats <kbd>"end"</kbd> and
	<kbd>"END"</kbd> differently.  (There will be no
	<kbd>b:match_infercase</kbd> unless someone requests it.) </li>
	<li><kbd>b:match_strings_like_comments</kbd>:
	If this variable has been defined then strings will be treated
	like comments.  For example,
	<kbd>'("(")'</kbd>
	will not be treated as unbalanced.</li>
	<li><kbd>b:match_debug</kbd>:
	Define this variable if you want debugging information to be saved.
	See the discussion <a href="#debug">debugging information</a>,
	below.</li>
	<a name="comments">
	<li><kbd>b:match_comment</kbd>:
	If this variable is defined then it is used instead of the
	syntax-highlighting mechanism to check for comments.  Set this
	variable to a regular expression that describes the comment character.
	This only works for one-line comments such as <kbd>'%'</kbd> for LaTeX
	and <kbd>'//'</kbd> for C++.  Then <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd> will treat
	anything that occurs after this regular expression in a line as a
	comment.

	<p>If you want <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd> to treat everything as a
	non-comment, you can<br>
	<kbd>:let b:match_comment = '$'</kbd><br>
	You get much the same effect by
	<kbd>:let b:match_comment = '^'</kbd><br>
	because then <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd> decides that the cursor started
	inside a comment and entirely skips checking for comments.

	<p>Note that, in LaTeX, <kbd>'\%'</kbd> is an escaped percent sign,
	not the comment character.  On the other hand, <kbd>'\\%'</kbd> is an
	escaped backslash followed by the comment character.  Thus the actual
	definition in the autocommand for LaTeX is<br>
	<kbd>let b:match_comment = '\(^\|[^\\]\)\(\\\\\)*%'</kbd><br>
	That is, the start of a line or a non-backslash character, followed by
	an even number (possibly zero) of backslashes (or a whole number of
	escaped backslashes) followed by the comment character.

	<p>You can get interesting effects in C++ by<br>
	<kbd>:let b:match_comment = '//'</kbd><br>
	Then anything inside
	<kbd>/*...*/</kbd>
	is treated as a non-comment and anything following a <kbd>'//'</kbd>
	is treated as a comment.  Try this at your own risk!
	</li>
</ul>

<a name="newlang">
<h1>To support a new language</h1>
In order for <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd> to support a new language, you must define
a suitable pattern for <kbd>b:match_words</kbd>.  You may also want to set
some of the other <a href="#configure">configuration variables</a>, as
described above.  If you figure out how to support a new language, please
<a href="mailto:benji@member.AMS.org">send me a copy</a> 
so that I can include it with future versions of <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd>.  If
your language has a complicated syntax, or many keywords, you will need to
know something about Vim's regular expressions, which are very well
documented:  <kbd>:help pattern</kbd>.  If you need help, see the section on
<a href="#support">support</a>, below.
<ol>
	<li>The format for <kbd>b:match_words</kbd> is similar to that of the
	<kbd>'matchpairs'</kbd> option:  it is a colon
	(<kbd>:</kbd>)-separated list of groups; each group is a
	comma(<kbd>,</kbd>)-separated list of patterns (regular expressions).
	it is OK to have only one group; the effect is undefined if a group
	has only one pattern.  A simple example is<br>
	<kbd>:let b:match_words =
	'\&lt;if\&gt;,\&lt;endif\&gt;:\&lt;while\&gt;,\&lt;continue\&gt;,\&lt;break\&gt;,\&lt;endwhile\&gt;'</kbd><br>
	(In Vim regular expressions, <kbd>'\&lt;'</kbd> and <kbd>'\&gt;'</kbd>
	denote word boundaries.  Thus <kbd>'if'</kbd> matches the end of
	<kbd>"endif"</kbd> but <kbd>'\&lt;if\&gt;'</kbd> does not.)  Then
	banging on the <kbd>%</kbd> key will bounce the cursor between
	<kbd>"if"</kbd> and the matching <kbd>'endif"</kbd>; and from
	<kbd>"while"</kbd> to any matching <kbd>"continue"</kbd> or
	<kbd>"break"</kbd>, then to the matching <kbd>"endwhile"</kbd> and
	back to the <kbd>"while"</kbd>.</li>
	<li>Once you have defined the appropriate value of
	<kbd>b:match_words</kbd>, you will probably want to have this set
	automatically each time you edit the appropriate file type.  The usual
	way of doing this is by adding an autocommand, either withing the
	function <kbd>Match_autocommands()</kbd> in the file
	<kbd>matchit.vim</kbd> or in some file that is sourced after you
	source <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd>.  Continuing the example above, the
	autocommand should be something like<br>
	<kbd>:autocmd Matchit FileType myft let b:match_words =<br>
	\ '\&lt;if\&gt;,\&lt;endif\&gt;:\&lt;while\&gt;,\&lt;continue\&gt;,\&lt;break\&gt;,\&lt;endwhile\&gt;'</kbd><br>
	If your version of vim does not support the <kbd>FileType</kbd>
	autocommand event then you can use <kbd>BufNewFile,BufRead
	*.myft</kbd> instead of <kbd>FileType myft</kbd>.  If you are using
	Vim 5.3 or earlier then the line continuation here will not work:  you
	will have to modify this to make it a single line, and make similar
	modifications to <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd>.</li>
	<li>Be careful that your initial pattern does not match your final
	pattern.  See the example above for the use of word-boundary
	expressions.</li>
	<li>It is usually better to use <kbd>'.\{-}'</kbd> (as many as
	necessary) instead of <kbd>'.*'</kbd> (as many as possible).  For
	example, in the string
	<kbd>"&lt;tag&gt;label&lt;/tag&gt;"</kbd>,
	<kbd>'&lt;.*&gt;'</kbd>
	matches the whole string whereas
	<kbd>'&lt;.\{-}&gt;'</kbd>
	and
	<kbd>'&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;'</kbd>
	match
	<kbd>"&lt;tag&gt;</kbd>
	and
	<kbd>"&lt;/tag&gt;"</kbd>.</li>
	<li>If <kbd>"if"</kbd> is to be paired with <kbd>"end if"</kbd> (Note
	the space!) then word boundaries are not enough.  Instead, define a
	regular expression <kbd>notend</kbd> that will match anything but
	<kbd>"end"</kbd> and use it as follows:<br>
	<kbd>let notend = '\(^\s*\|[^d\t ]\s\+\)'</kbd><br>
	let b:match_words = notend . '\&lt;if\&gt;,\&lt;end\s\+if\&gt;'<br>
	This is a simplified version of what is done for Ada.  For details,
	including how to do it while making <kbd>notend</kbd> a local
	variable, see the autocommand for Ada in <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd>.
	Similarly, you may want to define a start-of-line regular
	expression<br>
	<kbd>:let sol = '\(^\|;\)\s*'</kbd><br>
	if keywords are only recognized after the start of a line or after a
	semicolon (<kbd>;</kbd>), with optional white space.</li>
	<li>In any group, the expressions
	<kbd>'\1'</kbd>, <kbd>'\2'</kbd>, ..., <kbd>'\9'</kbd>
	refer to parts of the <strong>initial</strong> pattern enclosed in
	<kbd>'\('</kbd>escaped parentheses<kbd>'\)'</kbd>.  These are referred
	to as <strong>back references</strong>, or backrefs.  For example,
	<kbd>'\&lt;b\(o\+\)\&gt;,\(h\)\1'</kbd>
	means that
	<kbd>"bo"</kbd> pairs with <kbd>"ho"</kbd>
	and
	<kbd>"boo"</kbd> pairs with <kbd>"hoo"</kbd>
	and so on.  Note that <kbd>'\1'</kbd> does <strong>not</strong> refer
	to the <kbd>'\(h\)'</kbd> in this example.  If you have
	<kbd>'\('</kbd>nested <kbd>'\('</kbd>parentheses<kbd>'\)\)'</kbd>
	then <kbd>'\d'</kbd> refers to the <kbd>d</kbd>-th
	<kbd>'\('</kbd>
	and everything up to and including the matching
	<kbd>'\)'</kbd>.  In
	<kbd>'\(nested\(parentheses\)\)'</kbd>,
	<kbd>'\1'</kbd> refers to everything and <kbd>'\2'</kbd> refers to
	<kbd>'\(parentheses\)'</kbd>.

	<p>If you use a variable such as <kbd>notend</kbd> or
	<kbd>sol</kbd> (as in the previous paragraph) then remember to count
	any <kbd>'\('</kbd> patterns in this variable.

	<p>It should be possible to resolve back references from any pattern
	in the group.  For example,<br>
	<kbd>:let b:match_words = '\(foo\)\(bar\),more\1,and\2,end\1\2'</kbd><br>
	would not work because
	<kbd>'\2'</kbd> cannot be determined from <kbd>"morefoo"</kbd> and
	<kbd>'\1'</kbd> cannot be determined from <kbd>"andbar"</kbd>.  On the
	other hand,<br>
	<kbd>:let b:match_words = '\(\(foo\)\(bar\)\),\3\2,end\1'</kbd><br>
	should work (and have the same effect as
	<kbd>'foobar,barfoo,endfoobar'</kbd>), although this has not been
	thoroughly tested.</li>
	<li>The special character <kbd>'\@!'</kbd> means "Put the
	cursor on the following character."  For example, if the keyword
	<kbd>"if"</kbd> must occur at the start of the line, with optional
	white space, you might use the pattern <kbd>'^\s*\@!if'</kbd> so
	that the cursor will end on the <kbd>"i"</kbd> instead of at the start
	of the line.  For another example, if HTML had only one tag then one
	could<br>
	<kbd>:let b:match_words =
	'&lt;,&gt;:&lt;\@!tag&gt;,&lt;\@!/tag&gt;'</kbd><br>
	so that <kbd>%</kbd> can bounce between matching <kbd>&lt;</kbd> and
	<kbd>&gt;</kbd> pairs or (starting on <kbd>"tag"</kbd> or
	<kbd>"/tag"</kbd>) between matching tags.</li>
	<a name="debug">
	<li>If you are having trouble figuring out the appropriate definition
	of <kbd>b:match_words</kbd> then you can take advantage of the same
	information I use when debugging the script.  This is especially true
	if you are not sure whether your patterns or my script are at fault!
	To make this more convenient, I have made the command
	<kbd>:MatchDebug</kbd>, which defines the variable
	<kbd>b:match_debug</kbd> and creates a <kbd>Matchit</kbd> menu.  This
	menu makes it convenient to check the values of the variables
	described below.  You will probably also want to read the
	<a href="#details">detailed description</a> below of what the script
	does.
	
	<p>Defining the variable <kbd>b:match_debug</kbd> causes the script to
	set the following variables, each time you hit the <kbd>%</kbd> key.
	Severasl of these are only defined if <kbd>b:match_words</kbd>
	includes backrefs.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><kbd>b:match_pat</kbd>:
		<kbd>b:match_words</kbd> with backrefs parsed</li>
		<li><kbd>b:match_match</kbd>:
		the bit of text that is recognized as a match</li>
		<li><kbd>b:match_col</kbd>:
		the cursor column of the start of the matching text</li>
		<li><kbd>b:match_wholeBR</kbd>:
		the comma-separated group of patterns that matches, with
		backrefs unparsed</li>
		<li><kbd>b:match_iniBR</kbd>:
		the first pattern in <kbd>b:match_wholeBR</kbd></li>
		<li><kbd>b:match_ini</kbd>:
		the first pattern in <kbd>b:match_wholeBR</kbd>, with backrefs
		resolved from <kbd>b:match_match</kbd></li>
		<li><kbd>b:match_tail</kbd>:
		the remaining patterns in <kbd>b:match_wholeBR</kbd>, with
		backrefs resolved from <kbd>b:match_match</kbd></li>
		<li><kbd>b:match_word</kbd>:
		the pattern from <kbd>b:match_wholeBR</kbd> that matches
		<kbd>b:match_match</kbd></li>
		<li><kbd>b:match_table</kbd>:
		The back reference <kbd>'\'.d</kbd> refers to the same thing
		as <kbd>'\'.table[d]</kbd> in <kbd>b:match_word</kbd>.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ol>

<a name="details">
<h1>Detailed description of the script</h1>
Here is an outline of what <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd> does each time you hit the
<kbd>%</kbd> key, which is mapped to call the function
<kbd>Match_wrapper()</kbd>.
<ol>
	<li>If there are backrefs in <kbd>b:match_words</kbd> then the first
	step is to produce a version in which these back references have been
	eliminated; if there are no backrefs then this step is skipped.  I
	refer to this process as <strong>parsing</strong>.  For
	example, <kbd>'\(foo\|bar\),end\1'</kbd> is parsed to yield
	<kbd>'\(foo\|bar\),end\(foo\|bar\)'</kbd>.
	This can get tricky, especially if there are nested groups, but that
	has not yet come up in practice.  I am a little concerned that, on
	some systems, this step may take too long.  It
	seems wasteful to repeat the same parsing each time you hit the
	<kbd>%</kbd> key, but I have not yet figured out a way to avoid this,
	making sure that the original and parsed versions are kept
	synchronized.  If debugging is turned on, the parsed version is saved
	as <kbd>b:match_pat</kbd>.</li>
	<li>Look for a word on the current line that matches the pattern just
	constructed.  Include the patterns from the <kbd>'matchpairs'</kbd>
	option.  Unfortunately, this is a little complicated:
	<ol type=a>
		<li>Insist on a match that ends on or after the cusor.
		Prefer a match that includes the cursor position (that
		is, one that starts on or before the cursor).</li>
		<li>Prefer a match that starts as close to the cursor as
		possible.</li>
		<li>Prefer a match in <kbd>b:match_words</kbd> to a
		match in <kbd>'matchpairs'</kbd>.  If more than one
		pattern in <kbd>b:match_words</kbd> matches, choose the
		one that is listed first.</li>
	</ol>
	It would probably be preferable to switch priorities (b) and
	(c), but that is very hard to do with regular expressions.  (Let
	me know if you think of a way.)
	<ul>
		<li>Example:  given the pattern
		<kbd>'&lt;,&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;/tag&gt;'</kbd>
		with the cursor on or before the <kbd>"&lt;"</kbd> in
		<kbd>"a &lt;tag&gt; is born"</kbd>.
		The pattern <kbd>'&lt;'</kbd> comes first, so it is preferred
		over <kbd>'&lt;tag&gt;'</kbd>, which also matches.  If the
		cursor is on the <kbd>"t"</kbd>, however, then 
		<kbd>'&lt;tag&gt;'</kbd> is preferred, because this matches a
		bit of text containing the cursor.  If the two groups of
		patterns were reversed then <kbd>'&lt;'</kbd> would never be
		preferred.</li>
		<li>Example:  given the pattern
		<kbd>'if,end if'</kbd>
		(Note the space!) and the string "end if".  If the cursor
		starts on the <kbd>"if"</kbd> then <kbd>'if'</kbd> matches,
		which is probably not what you want, but if the cursor starts
		on the <kbd>"end "</kbd> then <kbd>'end if'</kbd> is chosen.
		</li>
	</ul>
	If there is no match, fall back on the usual behavior of <kbd>%</kbd>.
	If there is a match, move the cursor to its start.
	If debugging is turned on, the matched bit of text is saved as
	<kbd>b:match_match</kbd> and the cursor column of the start of the
	match is saved as <kbd>b:match_col</kbd>.</li>
	<li>Next, the script looks through <kbd>b:match_words</kbd> (original
	and parsed versions) for the group and pattern that match.
	If debugging is turned on, the group is saved as <kbd>b:match_ini</kbd>
	(the first pattern) and <kbd>b:match_tail</kbd> (the rest).  If there
	are backrefs then, in addition, the matching pattern is saved as
	<kbd>b:match_word</kbd> and a table of translations is saved as
	<kbd>b:match_table</kbd>.</li>
	<li>If there are backrefs, these are determined from the matching
	pattern and <kbd>b:match_match</kbd> and substituted into each pattern
	in the matching group.</li>
	<li>The script decides whether to search forwards or backwards and
	calls the function <kbd>Match_Busca()</kbd> with appropriate arguments.
	This function pays attention to whether the cursor is in a comment and
	so on.  It implements the usual algorithm for finding matching
	parentheses:  it counts +1 each time the "openening" pattern is found
	and -1 each time the "closing" pattern is found, and stops when it
	reaches zero.  "Opening" and "closing" are interpreted correctly
	depending on the direction of search, and "in between" patterns are
	treated appropriately.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Known Bugs and Limitations</h1>
Just because I know about a bug does not mean that it is on my todo list.  I
try to be responsive to reports of bugs that cause real problems.  If it does
not cause serious problems, or if there is a work-around, a bug may sit there
for a while.  Moral:  if a bug (known or not) bothers you,
<a href="#support">let me know</a>.

<ul>
	<li>I think that the comma (<kbd>,</kbd>) and colon (<kbd>:</kbd>) are
	used backwards compared to the syntax for <kbd>'matchpairs'</kbd>.  I
	may change this in the next version.</li>
	<li>Since the comma (<kbd>,</kbd>) and colon (<kbd>:</kbd>) are used
	to separate patterns, they cannot be used as part of a pattern.  I
	suppose this could be solved by interpreting <kbd>\,</kbd> and
	<kbd>\:</kbd> as literal characters, but this might be harder than it
	sounds...  </li>
	<li>Update:  I think I have solved this.
	The script does not recognize <kbd>\\</kbd> as an escaped
	backslash.  Thus <kbd>\\1</kbd>, <kbd>\\(</kbd>, and <kbd>\\)</kbd>
	cause problems.  This is a problem for LaTeX, where it would be nice
	to add <kbd>'\\(,\\)'</kbd> to <kbd>b:match_words</kbd>.</li>
	<li>Update:  I think I have solved this.
	The script may not treat <kbd>^</kbd> and <kbd>$</kbd> as start-
	and end-of-line in all cases.  A bug report would help in diagnosing
	this if, in fact, there is a problem.</li>
	<li>It would be nice if <kbd>\0</kbd> were recognized as the entire
	pattern.  That
	is, it would be nice if <kbd>'foo,\end\0'</kbd> had the same effect as
	<kbd>'\(foo\),\end\1'</kbd>.  I may try to implement this in a future
	version.  (This is not so easy to arrange as you might think.)</li>

<h1>Getting Help</h1>
For most purposes, the best source of help is the
<a href="mailto:vim@vim.org">vim mailing list</a>.
Note that you must
<a href="http://www.vim.org/mail.html#subscribe" target="_top">subscribe</a>
to the list before you can post questions.  Why is this usually better than
mailing me directly?
<ul>
	<li>Someone may already have worked out the language you are trying to
	support.  They may have neglected to send me the definitions, or I may
	not have gotten around to including them in <kbd>matchit.vim</kbd>, or
	you may not have the most recent version.</li>
	<li>I may be on vacation, or way behind on my e-mail, or I may have
	given up supporting this script.  The list is always there, and there
	are helpful people around the world (in many, if not all, time zones)
	who might help you out.</li>
	<li>Posting questions to the list has the side effect of advertising
	this useful script (and thereby stroking my ego).  For this reason,
	please include the URL when posting questions to the list.</li>
	<li>I read the list, so you are as likely to reach me that way as you
	are by e-mailing me directly.</li>
</ul>
If, after all that, you still want to send me e-mail directly (compliments or
bug reports, for example) then

<h1>Change Log</h1>
<ul>
<li>990112  (1999 Ene 12)   Raul Segura Acevedo:  original author.</li>
<li>24-Feb-2000 pottsdl<br>
fixed searching mechanism to check for 'comment' syntax attribute, keeps it
from finding a false match 'inside' a comment.</li>
<li>March 8, 2000  Benji Fisher:<br>
  I added comments, did a few things to simplify it (without changing
  the function, I hope) and modified the definitions of
  <kbd>b:match_words</kbd>
  for vim files, added a definition for LaTeX files.</li>
<li>March 10, 2000  Benji Fisher:<br>
  I rewrote the function <kbd>Busca()</kbd> to make it non-recursive.
  I succeeded, but
it is still very slow.  (On a 900-line LaTeX document, it takes 2 or 3 seconds
to go from <kbd>\begin{document}</kbd> to <kbd>\end{document}</kbd>.
This is on a 400-MHz Pentium II.)</li>
<li>March 19, 2000  Benji Fisher:<br>
  I cleaned things up:  removed raw <kbd>&lt;CR&gt;</kbd> characters, removed redundancy from
<kbd>Busca()</kbd>, and so on.  I added the <kbd>b:match_comment</kbd> option.
This speeds it up for LaTeX:  on the sample file described above, it takes less
than a second.</li>
<li>April 6, 2000 Benji Fisher:<br>
  Minor changes:  uncomment autocommands at end of file (some lines that had
been commented out caused problems), added a test for
<kbd>b:match_words=""</kbd> to the
test for <kbd>exists("b:match_words")</kbd>,
fixed the vim pattern for <kbd>aug...aug END</kbd>.
Then posted this as the non-beta version.</li>
<li>Late April, 2000 Benji Fisher:<br>
  Following a suggestion of Johannes Zellner, I implemented back references
  and posted this as the new beta version.
  This is a major change; I now consider this my own script, not merely a
  script with which I am tinkering.  I posted this for beta testing.  Since
  then, I have fixed a bug or two, played with the definitions of
  <kbd>b:match_words</kbd>, added the <kbd>b:match_ignorecase</kbd> option,
  and started the HTML documentation.  </li>
<li>May 23, 2000 Benji Fisher:<br>
  I finished the documentation and declared that beta testing was done for this
  version.  Now, I can start thinking about improving the script again!</li>
<li>May 27, 2000 Benji Fisher:<br>
  I fixed it so that <kbd>b:match_match</kbd> and <kbd>b:match_col</kbd> get
  set (assuming debugging is turned on) even if the script bails out and calls
  <kbd>:normal! %</kbd>.  I also postponed the first time that the cursor is
  moved, eliminated the <kbd>top_of_screen</kbd> variable used in defining
  <kbd>restore_screen</kbd>, and fixed the <kbd>'</kbd> mark.  I implemented
  <kbd>g%</kbd> to go backwards and I implemented the option
  <kbd>b:match_strings_like_comments</kbd>.</li>
<li>July 15, 2000 Benji Fisher:<br>
  I added support for DTD and updated XML, both thanks to Johannes Zellner.</li>
<li>November 22, 2000 Benji Fisher:<br>
  I added support for <kbd>&lt;count&gt;%</kbd> in Normal mode, after
  Bram Moolenaar pointed out that this was broken.  I have not figured
  out how to do this in Visual mode.  Update:  it is not my fault.
  There is a patch in current versions of vim 6.0 that allows one to
  access v:count after starting in Visual mode.</li>
<li>December 20, 2000 Benji Fisher:<br>
  I have tried to fix it so that <kbd>'\\'</kbd> is recognized as an
  escaped backslash.  It seems to work for TeX:  I added matching rules
  for equations delimited by <kbd>'\('</kbd> and <kbd>'\)'</kbd>.</li>
<li>December 22, 2000 Benji Fisher:<br>
  I implemented <kbd>'\@!'</kbd> to be similar to what it means in vim 6.0:
  <kbd>'&lt;\@!foo&gt;'</kbd> means to put the cursor after the
  <kbd>&lt;</kbd>.  In the process, I also added the helper function
  <kbd>Match_choose()</kbd>.  Although this saves only a few lines in the main
  program, it simplifies the flow (removing an explicit loop) and reduces the
  number of variables, which make it easier to understand.</li>
<li>December 31, 2000 Benji Fisher:<br>
  After playing with vim 6.0, I realized that the <kbd>'\@!'</kbd>
  mentioned above should really be <kbd>'\@&lt;='</kbd>, and modified
  the script accordingly.  I added support for Lua (Max Ischenko) and ASP
  with VBS (Gontran BAERTS), and added jsp to the html autocommands
  (Scott Johnston).  I also fixed a bug in the cursor-positioning code,
  which showed up if <kbd>"if...endif...if"</kbd> all appeared on one
  line.</li>
<li>December 31, 2000 Benji Fisher:<br>
  Progress on updating the script for vim 6.0!  I simplified the script
  with the new syntax for <kbd>strlen()</kbd> and script-local variables
  (which simplified the autocommands).  I added a check for
  <kbd>'cpo'</kbd> and another against double loading (both suggested by
  the docs and by Dr. C).  The new <kbd>search()</kbd> function greatly
  simplifies the <kbd>s:Busca()</kbd> function!  I switched the meaning
  of commas and colons in <kbd>b:match_words</kbd>, to be consistent
  with the <kbd>'matchpairs'</kbd> option.  I think this has been
  backwards since before I started maintaining the script.
